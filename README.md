## Approach Taken

I started this project with a relatively simple idea for a trivia game.  I began by creating major HTML components, and creating one question to start with.  I then placed my questions with their accompanying choices and answers into an array of objects to later iterate through.  Once this was completed, I used JavaScript and the DOM to make the game more dynamic with each question.
